Project Description: This is my personal portfolio website that highlights my work, experience, and interests. The main goal behind this project was to create a site that represents who I am while also showing my skills as a developer. The design is focused on being clean, organized, and easy to navigate. The homepage includes an About Me section where I introduce myself and give a quick overview of my background. I also built a Travel page that displays some of the cities I have visited along with photos. The portfolio also has a Resume page that users can look through, and a Contact page for people whoever might want to reach out.

Technologies Used:
1. React + Vite
2. JavaScript
4. React Router for navigation between pages
5. AOS for animations and scroll effects
6. CSS for styling and layout
7. GitHub Actions for automated builds
8. Node 24 for running the project locally

Lessons Learned: Building this project helped me improve my React skills and understand how to structure pages in a cleaner way. I learned how to use reusable components, set up different pages with routing, and add animations to make the design look better. I also got better at handling build errors, updating scripts, and using GitHub Actions to automate the build. Overall, this project helped me understand what it takes to organize and build a real frontend project from start to finish.

Future Scope: There are still a lot of features I want to add to this portfolio as I keep improving it. One of the main things I want to focus on is upgrading the UI and animations to make everything look smoother and more professional. Another plan is to add more travel locations and photos to the Travel page since that part of the site will keep growing over time. I also want to expand the site by adding new sections, like a blog or a page that highlights more of my personal projects. This will make the website more interactive and show more of my work. I plan to keep improving the overall design, responsive layout, and content as I continue learning new things. The site is already deployed on Netlify, so I will keep updating it and pushing changes as the project evolves.
